"""
Top-level services package

This file re-exports commonly used services to provide a single import
surface for application code. Keep this file minimal â€” prefer importing
subpackages directly in new modules to avoid large import graphs.

Structure:
- app.services.auth (auth related services and routers)
- app.services.content (content-related services: analysis, prompts, talking points)
- app.services.storage (storage helper services)
- app.services.processing (processing pipelines)
