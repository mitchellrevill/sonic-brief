"""
Top-level services package

This file re-exports commonly used services to provide a single import
surface for application code. Keep this file minimal â€” prefer importing
subpackages directly in new modules to avoid large import graphs.

Structure:
- app.services.auth (auth related services and routers)
- app.services.content (content-related services: analysis, prompts, talking points)
- app.services.storage (storage helper services)
- app.services.processing (processing pipelines)

from . import auth as auth

# Only export stable, present modules. Avoid re-exporting files that may not exist
# (user_service/password_service were removed or are optional). Import job helpers
# explicitly where needed instead of re-exporting fragile globals.
# New job-related helpers (imported by callers via app.services.jobs)
