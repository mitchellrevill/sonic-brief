"""
These component tests validate BUSINESS LOGIC:

1. File Type Rules:
   ✅ MP3/WAV/MP4 allowed (business requirement)
   ✅ EXE blocked (security requirement)
   ✅ Clear business justification for each rule

2. Permission Hierarchies:
   ✅ Admin > Editor > User > Public (defined hierarchy)
   ✅ Each level has specific capabilities
   ✅ Business justification for restrictions

3. Job Ownership:
   ✅ One owner per job (business invariant)
   ✅ Owner cannot change (audit trail)
   ✅ Shared users != owners (clear responsibility)

4. Job Lifecycle:
   ✅ Valid state transitions (predictable workflow)
   ✅ Invalid transitions blocked (prevent corruption)
   ✅ Business rules for each state

5. Data Integrity:
   ✅ Audit trails never lost (compliance)
   ✅ Required fields always present (data quality)
   ✅ Business invariants maintained

All tests validate BUSINESS VALUE not code coverage:
- Rules that define how the business works
- Constraints that protect business data
- Invariants that ensure business logic integrity
