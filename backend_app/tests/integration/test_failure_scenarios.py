"""
These failure scenario tests validate RESILIENCE:

1. Database Failures:
   ✅ System degrades gracefully, no crashes
   ✅ Clear error messages to users
   ✅ Automatic recovery when DB returns

2. Auth Service Failures:
   ✅ Fail secure (deny access, don't bypass)
   ✅ Clear "service unavailable" messages
   ✅ Existing sessions protected

3. File Upload Failures:
   ✅ Network issues handled with clear messages
   ✅ Quota limits communicated clearly
   ✅ Users understand what to do next

4. Permission System Failures:
   ✅ Fail secure (deny access when in doubt)
   ✅ Clear access error messages
   ✅ Security logging continues
   ✅ NO DATA LEAKS during failures

All tests focus on USER EXPERIENCE during failures:
- Clear error messages (not stack traces)
- Graceful degradation (not complete crashes)
- Security maintained (fail secure)
- Users understand what happened and what to do
