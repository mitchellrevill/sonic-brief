  Hi Sam, good to see you again.
  How have you been feeling since our last visit?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Hey, it's been up and down but I'm managing.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  I'm glad to hear you're managing.
  Any specific UPS or downs you'd like to talk about today?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Well, I had a rough patch a few days ago, almost slipped back but I called my sponsor.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's a really positive step.
  Sam reaching out shows a lot of strength.
  How did that conversation with your sponsor help?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  He reminded me why I'm doing this and walked me through some breathing exercises.
  It really helped.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  It's great to hear you have that support.
  Let's make sure we build on that.
  Have you been attending your support groups regularly?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Yeah, I went to the last three meetings.
  They're really helpful.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's wonderful.
  Consistency is key.
  And how about your new job?
  How's it going?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  It's going well, it keeps me busy and my coworkers are nice.
  It's a good distraction.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's fantastic to hear.
  Stability with work can make a huge difference.
  Any challenges you're facing at work that we can talk through?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Sometimes the stress gets to me, but I'm managing with what we discussed about time management and taking breaks.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Good.
  Remember it's all about balancing work and self-care.
  Have you been able to incorporate any new hobbies or activities?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  I started painting, it's actually pretty relaxing.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's amazing Sam, expressing yourself through art can be very therapeutic.
  Have you noticed it helps with managing cravings or stress?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Yeah, when I'm painting, I'm focused and calm.
  It takes my mind off things.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's great to hear.
  Finding healthy distractions is important.
  Have you set any new goals for yourself recently?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  I want to finish a whole painting by the end of this month.
  It's a small goal, but it keeps me motivated.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Small goals are fantastic.
  They add up over time. [Confidence: 0.69]
  How about your physical health?
  Have you been keeping up with exercise?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  I've been going for walks in the evening, it's a good way to clear my head.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Perfect physical activity can do wonders for your mental health as well.
  Have you experienced any cravings or triggers this week?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Just that one rough patch I mentioned, but I handled it.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  That's impressive, Sam.
  It's all about recognizing those moments and having strategies ready.
  Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or need support with right now?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Maybe some tips on dealing with stress at work?
  Sometimes it just feels overwhelming.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Absolutely.
  We can go over some techniques like mindfulness, deep breathing exercises and breaking tasks into smaller manageable chunks.
  Sound good?

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Yeah, that would be really helpful.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Excellent.
  We'll work through these strategies together.
  You're doing an amazing job, Sam.
  Keep up the good work.
  Let's set a few goals for this week and we'll follow up next time.

--- Speaker 2 ---
  Thanks for all your support, I really appreciate it.

--- Speaker 1 ---
  Anytime, Sam, we're in this together.
  See you next week.
