# Azure AI Transcription Accelerator Deployment User Guide
![Architecture Design](images/image.png)


## Introduction

This user guide provides instruction on manually deploying the Transcription accelerator developed by Microsoft, which will transcribe an audio recording and output it into a template using AI. If you are deploying this and want to use existing resources, then you can just deploy the additional resources you require and configure them accordingly. This deployment guide takes approximately 2.5 hours to completion.

* **Azure Static Web Apps**: Provides a web interface for user interaction.
* **Azure App Service**: Handles backend logic for user management, file handling, and workflow execution.
* **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores audio recordings, transcriptions, and reports.
* **Azure Functions**: Processes voice recordings asynchronously, handling transcription and summarization tasks.
* **Azure Speech-to-Text API**: Converts audio into structured text.
* **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o**: Summarizes transcriptions and refines text output.
* **CosmosDB (Document, Serverless)**: Manages metadata, logs, and user records.


## Prerequisites
